# NightTabHelper

This is a tool designed to help users of the project Night Tab. If you host your own NightTab on a webserver this is so you can create your own default files instead of needing to edit the javascript files manually

With this tool if you load Nighttab up on one browser and set it up using the GUI and then export the json file that nighttab uses, you can import it into NightTabHelper tool and it will write out a new bookmarks.js and state.js files which you can then replace the default files that came with night tab.

the purpose of this is so the user does not need to setup the night tab page on every browser or need to import the json file over and over for every browser
it just makes it simpler
